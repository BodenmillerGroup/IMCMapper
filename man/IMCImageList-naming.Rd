\title{Getting and setting the channel and image names}
\description{
Methods to get and set the names of individual channels or the names of
individual images.
}
\section{Setting and getting the channel names}{

In the following code, \code{x} is either an \linkS4class{IMCImageList} or
\linkS4class{Image} object containing one or multiple channels.
The channel names can be replaced by \code{value}, which contains a character
vector of the same length as the number of channels in the image(s).
\describe{
\item{\code{channelNames(x)}:}{Returns the names of all channels stored in
\code{x}}
\item{\code{channelNames(x) <- value}:}{Replaces the channel names of
\code{x} with \code{values}. For this, \code{value} needs to have the same
length as the number of channels in \code{x}}
}
}

\section{Setting and getting the image names}{

Here, \code{x} is either a \linkS4class{IMCImageList} object. The element names
can be replaced by \code{value}, which contains a character vector of the
same length as the number of images. In case of the IMCImageList object,
elements are always images.
\describe{
\item{\code{names(x)}:}{Returns the names of all images stored in \code{x}}
\item{\code{names(x) <- value}:}{Replaces the image names of
\code{x} with \code{values}. For this, \code{value} needs to have the same
length as \code{x}}
}
}

\examples{
data("pancreasImages")

# Get channel and image names
channelNames(pancreasImages)
names(pancreasImages)

# Set channel and image names
channelNames(pancreasImages) <- paste0("marker", 1:5)
names(pancreasImages) <- paste0("image", 1:3)
