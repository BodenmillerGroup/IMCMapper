Title: Visualization of multiplexed, spatial single-cell data 
Description: 
    In recent years, multiplexed imaging approaches have been developed 
    to aquire single-cell read-outs (e.g. RNA or proteins) in a spatially 
    resolved fashion. These information can therefore be visualized across
    multiple length-scales. First, pixel-level information d isplays the 
    most resolved features within the images. Second, after segementation
    the cells' expression values can be visualized on segmented cell areas.
    Last, these technologies allow the detection and visualization  of 
    cellular super-structures such as stroma/tumour compartments or 
    pancreatic islets. These information are stored in image stacks where each
    individual image contains the pixel-level information of individual channels 
    (individual protein or RNA species).
    This package contains functions for the visualization of multiplexed 
    read-outs of spatially resolved single-cell technologies on images.
    It requires three data objects for visualization: 1. a SingleCellExperiment
    object which contains the cells' counts and metadata, 2. an ImageList or 
    Image object containing the pixel-level information per channel and/or 
    3. an ImageList or Image object containing the segemntation mask per image.
    The main functionality of this package includes the individual or multiplexed 
    visualization of pixel- and cell-level information for all aquired read-outs.
    Furthermore, it allows the visualization of user-defined metadata.
